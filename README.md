# CONQUEERING MNIST FASHION USING CNNs AND COMPUTER VISION
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN/ConvNet) is a specialized type of deep neural network primarily used for analyzing visual data, such as images or 
videos. 


▪ Unlike traditional neural networks that rely on general matrix multiplication, CNNs utilize convolution operations in at least one of their layers.


▪ Convolution, in the context of CNNs, refers to the process of applying a set of filters or kernels to the input image. Each filter detects specific patterns or 
features, such as edges or textures, by convolving it across the image. 

▪ This results in the extraction of relevant features and the creation of feature maps that highlight the presence of these patterns in different regions of the 
image

Computer Vision Tasks

Classification: categorizing an image or an object into predefined classes or categories. The goal is to assign a label or a class to the entire image or a 
specific region within the image.


▪ Localization: It refers to the task of identifying and localizing objects within an image. It involves not only determining the class or category of an object but also providing the precise location or bounding box coordinates that enclose the object.

▪ Object Detection: It combines classification and localization to identify and locate multiple objects within an image. It involves detecting and classifying 
objects while providing bounding box coordinates for each detected object. 



▪ Instance segmentation: It involves identifying and delineating individual objects within an image. It goes a step beyond object detection by not only 
detecting and classifying objects but also providing pixel-level segmentation masks that separate each object instance from its surroundings.
